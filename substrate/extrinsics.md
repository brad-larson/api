### setUncles(new_uncles: `Vec<Header>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.authorship.setUncles`
- **summary**:   Provide a set of uncles.

## balances
 
### forceTransfer(source: `LookupSource`, dest: `LookupSource`, value: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.forceTransfer`
- **summary**:   Exactly as `transfer`, except the origin must be root and the source account may be specified. \# \<weight>

   

  - Same as transfer, but additional read and write because the source account is  not assumed to be in the overlay. 

  \# \</weight> 
 
### setBalance(who: `LookupSource`, new_free: `Compact<Balance>`, new_reserved: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.setBalance`
- **summary**:   Set the balances of a given account. 

  This will alter `FreeBalance` and `ReservedBalance` in storage. it will also decrease the total issuance of the system (`TotalIssuance`). If the new free or reserved balance is below the existential deposit, it will reset the account nonce (`frame_system::AccountNonce`). 

  The dispatch origin for this call is `root`. 

  \# \<weight>

   

  - Independent of the arguments.

  - Contains a limited number of reads and writes.

  ---------------------

  - Base Weight:

      - Creating: 27.56 µs

      - Killing: 35.11 µs

  - DB Weight: 1 Read, 1 Write to `who`

  \# \</weight> 
 
### transfer(dest: `LookupSource`, value: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.transfer`
- **summary**:   Transfer some liquid free balance to another account. 

  `transfer` will set the `FreeBalance` of the sender and receiver. It will decrease the total issuance of the system by the `TransferFee`. If the sender's account is below the existential deposit as a result of the transfer, the account will be reaped. 

  The dispatch origin for this call must be `Signed` by the transactor. 

  \# \<weight>

   

  - Dependent on arguments but not critical, given proper implementations for  input config types. See related functions below. 

  - It contains a limited number of reads and writes internally and no complex computation.

  Related functions: 

    - `ensure_can_withdraw` is always called internally but has a bounded complexity. 

    - Transferring balances to accounts that did not exist before will cause     `T::OnNewAccount::on_new_account` to be called. 

    - Removing enough funds from an account will trigger `T::DustRemoval::on_unbalanced`.

    - `transfer_keep_alive` works the same way as `transfer`, but has an additional    check that the transfer will not kill the origin account. 

  ---------------------------------

  - Base Weight: 73.64 µs, worst case scenario (account created, account removed)

  - DB Weight: 1 Read and 1 Write to destination account

  - Origin account is already in memory, so no DB operations for them.

  \# \</weight> 
 
### transferKeepAlive(dest: `LookupSource`, value: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.balances.transferKeepAlive`
- **summary**:   Same as the [`transfer`] call, but with a check that the transfer will not kill the origin account. 

  99% of the time you want [`transfer`] instead. 

  [`transfer`]: struct.Module.html#method.transfer \# \<weight>

   

  - Cheaper than transfer because account cannot be killed.

  - Base Weight: 51.4 µs

  - DB Weight: 1 Read and 1 Write to dest (sender is in overlay already)#</weight>

  * If no account exists and the call value is not less than `existential_deposit`,a regular account will be created and any value will be transferred. 
 
### claimSurcharge(dest: `AccountId`, aux_sender: `Option<AccountId>`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.contracts.claimSurcharge`
- **summary**:   Allows block producers to claim a small reward for evicting a contract. If a block producer fails to do so, a regular users will be allowed to claim the reward. 

  If contract is not evicted as a result of this call, no actions are taken and the sender is not eligible for the reward.

  Instantiation is executed as follows: 

  - The destination address is computed based on the sender and hash of the code. 

  - The smart-contract account is created at the computed address.

  - The `ctor_code` is executed in the context of the newly-created account. Buffer returned  after the execution is saved as the `code` of the account. That code will be invoked   upon any call received by this account. 

  - The contract is initialized.
 
### putCode(code: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.contracts.putCode`

### vouch(who: `AccountId`, value: `BalanceOf`, tip: `BalanceOf`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.society.vouch`
- **summary**:   As a member, vouch for someone to join society by placing a bid on their behalf. 

  There is no deposit required to vouch for a new bid, but a member can only vouch for one bid at a time. If the bid becomes a suspended candidate and ultimately rejected by the suspension judgement origin, the member will be banned from vouching again. 

  As a vouching member, you can claim a tip if the candidate is accepted. This tip will be paid as a portion of the reward the member will receive for joining the society. 

  The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ and a member. 

  Parameters: 

  - `who`: The user who you would like to vouch for.

  - `value`: The total reward to be paid between you and the candidate if they becomea member in the society. 

  - `tip`: Your cut of the total `value` payout when the candidate is inducted intothe society. Tips larger than `value` will be saturated upon payout.

  	- Up to one storage removal if bid.len() > MAX_BID_COUNT. O(1)

  - Notable Computation:

  	- O(log M) search to check sender is a member.

  	- O(B + C + log M) search to check user is not already a part of society.

  	- O(log B) search to insert the new bid sorted.

  - External Module Operations:

  	- One balance reserve operation. O(X)

  	- Up to one balance unreserve operation if bids.len() > MAX_BID_COUNT.

### submitElectionSolution(winners: `Vec<ValidatorIndex>`, compact: `CompactAssignments`, score: `ElectionScore`, era: `EraIndex`, size: `ElectionSize`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.staking.submitElectionSolution`
- **summary**:   Submit an election result to the chain. If the solution: 

  1. is valid. 2. has a better score than a potentially existing solution on chain. 

  then, it will be _put_ on chain. 

  A solution consists of two pieces of data: 

  1. `winners`: a flat vector of all the winners of the round. 2. `assignments`: the compact version of an assignment vector that encodes the edge    weights. 

  Both of which may be computed using _phragmen_, or any other algorithm. 

  Additionally, the submitter must provide: 

  - The `score` that they claim their solution has. 

  Both validators and nominators will be represented by indices in the solution. The indices should respect the corresponding types ([`ValidatorIndex`] and [`NominatorIndex`]). Moreover, they should be valid when used to index into [`SnapshotValidators`] and [`SnapshotNominators`]. Any invalid index will cause the solution to be rejected. These two storage items are set during the election window and may be used to determine the indices. 

  A solution is valid if: 

  0. It is submitted when [`EraElectionStatus`] is `Open`. 1. Its claimed score is equal to the score computed on-chain. 2. Presents the correct number of winners. 3. All indexes must be value according to the snapshot vectors. All edge values must    also be correct and should not overflow the granularity of the ratio type (i.e. 256    or billion). 4. For each edge, all targets are actually nominated by the voter. 5. Has correct self-votes. 

  A solutions score is consisted of 3 parameters: 

  1. `min { support.total }` for each support of a winner. This value should be maximized. 2. `sum { support.total }` for each support of a winner. This value should be minimized. 3. `sum { support.total^2 }` for each support of a winner. This value should be    minimized (to ensure less variance)

### unbond(value: `Compact<BalanceOf>`)

  Once the unlock period is done, you can call `withdraw_unbonded` to actually move the funds out of management ready for transfer. 

  No more than a limited number of unlocking chunks (see `MAX_UNLOCKING_CHUNKS`) can co-exists at the same time. In that case, [`Call::withdraw_unbonded`] need to be called first to remove some of the chunks (if possible). 

  The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash. And, it can be only called when [`EraElectionStatus`] is `Closed`.

  Emits `Withdrawn`.
